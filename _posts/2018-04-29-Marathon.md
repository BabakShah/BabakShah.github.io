## Introduction

The main goal of this project is prediction of marathon race time in male and female runners. 

## Data Source

The <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data" target="_blank">data</a> is sourced from the website of six world major marathons namely: Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, NYC. The data is scraped from these websites using web scraping technologies like Beautiful Soup and Selenium

<!--### Data pre-processing

Data was cleaned and preprocessed before modeling. Dropped the duplicates, the NA values. Also parsed the date column single date and time stamp and broke it into components (year, month, day, hour, minute). Also, used label encoder function to one hot encode the arrest labels.

### Data balancing

From the 350K crime reports, in only about 68K the arrest was made (arrest == True) and the rest no arrest was made. Since the classification is on arrest made or not, it's important to balance the data so there are similar counts for each class. This was done using a combination of over- and under-sampling. There are systematic algorithms that you can use to generate synthetic samples available in sklearn library. I used SMOTENN or the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. 

### Data train and test split

The data was split into training and testing sets. 80% of data assigned for learning and training and the remaining 20% of data assigned for testing purposes.-->

## Feature Selection

The more relevant features picked for predicting marathon times are athlete's age, percentage of body fat, average running speed, weather, terrain, and running footwear.

## Modeling

I used two Ordinary Least Square models for male and female athletes. I also tried Lasso and Ridge regression with cross validation and tuning. Lasso regression with alpha=0.0001 was my best model. The adjusted R-squared of the male model was 0.44 and for the female model was 0.71. The images below show the final models for both genders:

Male race time (min) = 285.4 
+ 2.316 × Body Fat (%) 
− 10.446 × Running Speed (kph) + 1.38 × Age 
− 1.02 × Running Shoe

Female race time (min) = 337.4 
+ 2.154 × Body Fat (%) 
− 15.112 × Running Speed (kph) + 1.27 × Age 
− 1.04 × Running Shoe

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests for development. The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need the following software for testing and development:

- Python (version 3)
- Command line interface
- Web browser (Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Safari supported)
- Source code editor like Atom or Sublime Text
- Git source control manager

### Cloning Repository

Start by opening the command line and downloading the repository as follows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BabakShah/...
```

change the directory to the project folder and the desired source file (Python, HTML, CSS, JS)

```bash
cd ./DS-Saf
```

in the command line, download all the python library dependencies

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

for further development, open the source files in a source code editor. For Python scripts

```bash
open -a "Sublime Text" file-name
```

for IPython notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook file-name
```
